    <!-- add horizontal navigation bar  to link to the 4 main web pagess

    <p> Responsive Web Design (RWD) is a well established method aimed at providing an optimal web viewing experience — easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computer monitors. 
    <br>G-RWD LLC is a company with a mission to improve the RWD experience for the geriatric (elderly) community. </p>

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p class="narrow">The first wave of baby boomer's age is already in their early 70's, and as this population increases, the need to address the technology adoption challenges of this aging population increases. And to further the challenge, Grandma is going mobile!  The application of RWD methods is critical for creating web pages that function across all platforms.  However, the biggest challenge which many are not addressing with RWD, is the need to apply RWD to the special requirements of the geriatric user.   </p>
    <p class="narrow">The unique special needs of the elderly are: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>- Physical constraints: The way older people hold devices or touch the screen can be problematic to the way touch screens have been developed. The average response time for an icon is 0.7 seconds - but the average response time of someone aged 65 or over is one second. Shaky hands, and multiple fingers on the screen at once can also cause problems.  </li>
            <li>- Impaired vision and hearing: there is more to this than just providing larger fonts and louder volume.  </li>
            <li>- Information overload: the elderly can get easily confused with too much data and too many options. </li>
            <li>... and much more!</li>
          </ul> 
          <br>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
